DevOps Project: CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins, SonarQube, and Docker
This project demonstrates a DevOps pipeline setup using AWS EC2 instances (virtual machines), Jenkins for Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD), SonarQube for code quality checks, and Docker for containerization. The entire setup is designed to automatically integrate code from GitHub, run quality checks, and deploy the application in containers.

üöÄ Project Overview
This project sets up a robust pipeline with the following components:

Jenkins: Automates the build, test, and deployment process.
SonarQube: Analyzes code quality and integrates with Jenkins to ensure best practices.
Docker: Packages the application into containers for easy deployment across different environments.
AWS EC2 Instances: Hosts the servers for Jenkins, SonarQube, and the application.
üîß Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

An AWS account and EC2 instances set up.
A GitHub account with a repository for your project.
Jenkins installed on one EC2 instance.
SonarQube installed on a separate EC2 instance.
Docker installed on another EC2 instance for containerization.
‚öôÔ∏è Setup Guide
1. AWS EC2 Instances
Set up 3 EC2 instances:
Jenkins server (for CI/CD)
SonarQube server (for code quality analysis)
Application Docker server (for containerization)
2. Jenkins Setup
Install Jenkins on the EC2 instance:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk
wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins.io.key | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/jenkins.asc
sudo sh -c 'echo deb http://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins.io.stable/ / > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list'
sudo apt update
sudo apt install jenkins
sudo systemctl start jenkins
sudo systemctl enable jenkins
Access Jenkins through http://<your-jenkins-server-ip>:8080 and complete the setup wizard.

3. GitHub Integration with Jenkins
Install the GitHub plugin on Jenkins.
Create a GitHub webhook to trigger Jenkins builds automatically whenever code is pushed.

4. SonarQube Setup
Install SonarQube on the EC2 instance:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk
wget https://binaries.sonarsource.com/Distribution/sonarqube/sonarqube-9.0.0.45655.zip
unzip sonarqube-9.0.0.45655.zip
sudo mv sonarqube-9.0.0.45655 /opt/sonarqube
cd /opt/sonarqube/bin/linux-x86-64
./sonar.sh start
Access SonarQube at http://<your-sonarqube-server-ip>:9000.

5. SonarQube Integration with Jenkins
Install the SonarQube plugin in Jenkins.
Configure Jenkins to use SonarQube for code analysis by connecting Jenkins to your SonarQube server via the Jenkins configuration.

6. Docker Setup
Install Docker on the Docker server EC2 instance:
bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker-ce
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
Create Docker images for your application, and push them to Docker Hub or AWS ECR.

üõ†Ô∏è How the Pipeline Works
Push Code to GitHub:

Developers push code to the GitHub repository.
Jenkins Triggers Build:

Jenkins detects the code change via GitHub Webhook.
Jenkins pulls the latest code from GitHub and triggers the build.
SonarQube Code Analysis:

Jenkins invokes SonarQube to analyze the code for quality issues.
If the code passes the quality checks, Jenkins proceeds with the build; otherwise, it notifies the developer.
Build and Containerize with Docker:

Jenkins creates a Docker image from the application code.
The image is pushed to Docker Hub or AWS ECR.
Deploy the Docker Container:

The Docker container is deployed to the Docker EC2 instance for testing or production.
üìú Conclusion
This project integrates Jenkins for automating the CI/CD pipeline, SonarQube for continuous code quality checks, and Docker for containerizing applications. The entire pipeline is hosted on AWS EC2 instances, ensuring scalability and reliability.
